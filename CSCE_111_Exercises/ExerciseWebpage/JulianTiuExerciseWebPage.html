<p>The internet changed a multitude of things in many different aspects of practical life.
In general, the spread and access of information at the touch of a button has become a reality.
It is a pain to look up scientific articles and journals now even with the internet, but imagine
a time when the scientit had to take a trip to the library just to access relevant scientific
journals. Thanks to the internet, e rapid sharing of scientific data is made possible. Scientists
now have the ability to store data in databases that other chemists can access.
</pr>

<p>In 2008, a group of scientist dicovered the power of YouTube. Scientist had the ability to not only
do chemistry, but to actually showcase their work for everyone to see. A group of chemists decided
to do a series in YouTube about each element in the periodic table. To this day, their channel now
has over 102 million views. These videos are now being used for students in many classes, and as well
as anyone who thinks chemistry is fun. YouTube has allowed a team of Chemists to spread their love of
chemistry to anyone who is willing to listen.

<p>
Back in the day prior to the use of the web, it was difficult for chemists to find jobs. It was
hard for professional chemists to find openings in the newspaper and other print ads, but that
was the best they could do. Today, specific chemistry openings are now available to view in the
matter of seconds. In a survey done by the <i><b>2014 ACS Salary and Employment Survey</b></i> reported that a third
of B.A. and B.S. students successfully acquired jobs they found on the internet. Social media
also allows chemists to post their work online that can be extremely helpful for potential employers.
</p>

<p>
In conlusion, the internet became the ultimate tool for the spread of information. This tremendously
helped chemistry to be able to spark interests, spread ideas, and for chemists to find specific job
openings. The TAMU students who are taking chemistry classes appriciate the online posts of these devoted
chemists for their solution to some difficult chemistry questions.
